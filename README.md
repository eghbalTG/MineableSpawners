* Define if users can change spawner types using spawn eggs.
* & more!


### Commands: Main command "/mineablespawners" or "ms"

   * "/ms give <player> <type> <amount>" => Give a player spawners.

### Dependencies:

   * Optional: Vault [https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault] and a compatible economy plugin like Essentials for the economy features.

### Metrics:
We use bStats to collect anonymous metrics (only grabs stuff like playercount, java version, server version and such). This helps me get some information about how used my plugin is and keeps me motivated. If you wish to turn it off you can in ./plugins/bStats/config.yml

Everything is configurable and explained in the configuration file!
